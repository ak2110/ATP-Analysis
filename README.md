# ATP-Analysis


I have always had a keen interest in tennis and closely followed the sport. Rafael Nadal has been my favorite player for a long time now. I wanted to dive deeper into player comparisons and gain insights about Nadal and other famous players in the world of tennis.

Thus I decided to conduct an analysis using the ATP Tennis dataset spanning the years 2000 to 2024. 

### Data Source ###

[ATP Tennis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dissfya/atp-tennis-2000-2023daily-pull)

### Dataset Description ###

This dataset consists of 60k+ data points for men's category tennis matches between the years 2000-2024. The regular updates (frequent pulls from the remote data sources) to this dataset provide a valuable opportunity to not only compare the performances of past and current players but also to gain insights into the emerging generation of tennis talent.

The process for updating the dataset from the remote sources is described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dissfya/atp-tennis-daily-pull).\
